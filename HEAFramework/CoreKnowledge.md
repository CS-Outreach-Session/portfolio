# Core Knowledge

## K1 - The subject material

Computing is a highly technical field and teaching it requires a great deal of knowledge. My background working in software development allows me to bring real world experience in to the classroom. This influences how I teach programming and software engineering related subjects. The difference between software engineering theory and software development in practice can be significant and being able to bring that awareness to the students is beneficial.  

During the revalidation of our programmes we were able to update our curriculum based on developments in technology, software and programming.

## K2 - Appropriate methods for teaching, learning and assessing in the subject area and at the level of the academic programme

Computing as an industry, especially software development, requires individual knowledge and ability, alongside teamwork which utilises differening knowledge and ability in team members. This poses a number of challenges teaching computing, especially in teaching programming. Is it possible to develop individual ability whilst also teaching efficient and smart use of differing knowledge in teams.  

Our approach is based around problem solving. Problem based learning is student focused and allows them to learn by doing. It is a form of Active learning - *"a method of learning in which students are actively or experientially involved in the learning process and where there are different levels of active learning, depending on student involvement."* (Bonwell & Eison 1991).

## K3 - How students learn, both generally and within their subject/disciplinary area(s)

In Computing at YSJ we have a wide range of students. Computing Science is not widely taught at school level so we have to assume no knowledge of computing and programming at the start of first year. However some students do study computer science and programming at school and others have taught themselves to program. This leads to a wide range of ability levels in first year students (who have come directly from school). Similarly mature students, and others who have not come directly from school, have a wide range of experience and knowledge. The challenge here is in getting all of the students to the same base level by the end of first year, getting those with no experience programming up to speed while maintaining the engagement and providing some challenge to those with significant experience.  

We have found that problem based learning is the best approach. We can provide a range of problems to the students that cover the course material and additional problems that give the experienced students the opportunity to push themselves further.  

Having the students work together in twos or threes works well with the problem based approach. Working together allows students with differing knowledge and understanding to work together to find solutions. Additionally many of the more knowledgable students enjoy helping others learn.

We have resources in place to help students with learning challenges. Our timetable is designed with some flexibility to help carers schedule their studies. We use Learning Support Plans (LSPs) to help students with specific requirements.

## K4 - The use and value of appropriate learning technologies

YSJ uses Moodle as its electronic blackboard system. We use Moodle to host lecture slides, class exercises, assessments and other content.  

I discuss various technology uses when discussing [Online Teaching](../CaseStudies/OnlineTeaching.md)

## K5 - Methods for evaluating the effectiveness of teaching 

* assessment - formative/summative
* feedback from students - midmodeval, end of year feadback
* NSS
* informal feedback from students - anonymised feedback
* internal feedback/POLT
* externam examiner
* industrial feedback
* reflection
