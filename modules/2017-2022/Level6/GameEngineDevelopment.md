# Game Engine Development

## Module Code : 3CB106, COM6006M

## Overview

This module was envisioned, by the original programme designers, as a module on developing game engines. This was too ambitious, to teach how to develop a game engine requires a high level of previous knowledge of the workings of the various components of game engines (physics engine, rendering, animation, sounds, scripting, etc.). The wording of the module specification was flexible enough that the module could be reworked to focus on developing *using* a game engine. This was the approach I've taken to the module.  

### 2019-20

I ran this module for two students and based it around developing a game using a game engine. I ran the module as a project based modules, the students were expected to develop a game using a game engine and evaluate the game engine and its components in the process. Instead of a lecture/lab based module I held weekly discussion sessions about game engine components and the progress of the project. This seemed appropriate given the small number of students. On reflection the students didn't fully engage with this approach to the module. One developed the game and the other produced weak documentation discussing the game engine.  

### 2020-21 

The module was taught online due to the Covid pandemic ([Online Teaching](../../../CaseStudies/OnlineTeaching.md)). I decided to move back to a more traditional lecture based approach for the module. Rather than working with a games project we looked at how various aspects of game engines worked, for the assessment students had to implement functionality of part of a game engine component. Student engagement was better with this approach but it was focused too much on the functionality specifics rather than a greater understanding of game engines.  

### 2021-22

Returning to face to face teaching on campus I tried an approach to teaching this module that was a hybrid of the two previous years. I gave weekly lectures about the components of game engines, discussing how the components work at a high level and the major issues relating to them. For the assessment the students had to create a game using a game engine. The game had to use multiple components of the game engine and they had write a document describing the game, how it used the engine and evaluate where the engine helped and hindered the development of the game. This approach worked well, engagement was good and the work produced by the students was good.
