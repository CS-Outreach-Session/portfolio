# Games Development Programme Revalidation

In 2021-22 we went through the revalidation process for our degree programmes. We go through this process every six years to ensure our degree programmes are kept up to date and relevant. This is essential for and computing based subjects where the technology and practices change rapidly. The revalidaiton process gave us a chance to not only update the programmes (and their modules) but also to consult with students (current and former), industrial partners and bodies to ensure we are teaching subjects that are desirable by students and prospective employers.  
## Goals

I had a number of goals in revalidation the Games Development programme.

* Increase the games content
* Always making games
* Keep tie-in/compatibility with CS/SE and new CY while developing a stronger GD identity
* Update module subjects and technology
* Reflect feedback from games students and reflect advice from games industry/developers

### Increase the games content

Our previous Games Development degree shared a substantial amount of content with out other degrees (Computer Science and Software Engineering). They shared a number of modules in programming, software engineering, research skills, etc. In total, eleven out of seventeen modules are shared with CS and SE. This made teaching our students easier but meant there was only a small amount of games content in the Games Development degree. I received feedback from students that they were disappointed that they didn't have more games content and had no games specific content in the second semesters of first and second year. I found it frustrating at the limited time available for games material.  

My goal for the revalidation was to ensure the Games Development students would have a games module every semester so they would always be learning about games. I've achieved this, the revalidated programme has raised the number of games modules from four out of seventeen to eight. There are now games modules each semester and the third year is entirely games focused.

| | Semester One | Semester Two |
|---|---|---|
| First Year | Games Fundamentals | Games Design |
| Second Year | Games Development <br> With Game Engines| Games Development Project <br>    |
| Third Year | Games Programming <br> 3D Graphics Programming | *Options, Choose Two* <br> AI For Games <br> Procedural Content Generation <br> Agile Game Development <br> iOS Game Development <br> Immersive Computing |

### Always making games

This goes hand in hand with increasing the games content. It is important that anyone wanting to work in the games industry should be making games. This gives the students chance to develop their skills and helps them put together a portfolio for job applications. Each module in the revalidated programme has been designed to include the creation of a game (or game content).

### Keep tie-in/compatibility with CS/SE and new CY while developing a stronger GD identity

As discussed above the original programmes shared a large number of modules. This was essential for us as a small department so we could teach all three programmes. The team has grown to six full time academics from only three when I started five years ago. While this increase in staff has allowed me to increase the games content we are still a small department and we need to utilise shared modules to enable is to provide the (now four) degree programmes. I worked together with the CS, SE and CY programme leads in developing modules which would form the shared core of all four degree programmes. Each programme is built around a set of shared modules covering the core material that each requires.  

### Update module subjects and technology

The technology and practices involved in any aspect of computing are constantly advancing, video games are no different, indeed video games are constantly pushing the limites of technology. As such it is important, essential that we ensure our modules reflect the latest advances. Revalidation allows us to update our programme and modules specifications for the current technology. The specifications have been written so that specific technologies/software are not mentioned, allowing us to update them as required over the years before the next revalidation.  

### Reflect feedback from games students and advice from games industry/developers

Feedback and advice were sought from current and former students, and from the games industry/developers and other academics in the field, as to what content they wanted to see in a games development programme. The feedback was consistant from all sources - a games development programme should be practical, with a strong foundation of programming and game engine usage. Practice in making (and finishing) games and producing a portfolio of work were also a common feature. (See Evidence below).  

The programme structure and modules reflect this feedback with a strong focus on programming (in the computing core and in the games modules) and game engine use.
