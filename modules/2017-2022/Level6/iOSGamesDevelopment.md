# iOS Game Development

## Module Code : 3CB111, COM6011M

## Overview

This module focuses on games development for iOS platforms (Mac, iPad, iPhone, etc).  

In 2020-21 second year students were asked to select thier optional modules for the next year. They were mistakenly offered the option to take the iOS Game Development module, this is a module we have never run previously and did not intent to offer. A significant number of students elected to take this module. We, in the department, only realised that they'd been offered the module in the middle of semester one 2021-22. Due to the number of students taking the module it was deemed appropriate to attempt to run the module. I volunteered to run the module since I have experience teaching game development although I had no experience with iOS programming. 

### 2021-22

The Macs we have in our first year lab are too old for this module so we subscribed to the MacInCloud cloud service to provide our students with a development environment. This service was adequate if not exceptional (the connection was laggy and limited, no sound was available).  

Weekliy lectures and lab sessions examined various aspects of games development for iOS using Xcode, Swift and the SpriteKit games library. For the assessment students were to develop a game using the concepts and techniques discussed in the lectures.  

The module worked well for a module unexpectedly run for the first time by a lecturer who was (barely) one week ahead of the students. We took the decision to continue running the module and to offer a version of it in the revalidated programmes. The main criticism I'd have is that I over-estimated the complexity of SpriteKit and under-estimated the students abilities. In future I'll be able to include more content and raise the level/difficulty of the module.
