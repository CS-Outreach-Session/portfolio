# Programming 03

## Module Code : 2CB101, COM5001M

## Overview

Programming 03 is the advanced programming module for our degree programmes (pre-revalidation). I took over this module in 2019 and changed the focus from advanced Java techniques to C, Assembly language and computer memory. The module examines how computer memory is used in applications, using C and assembly programming to access the memory at a lower level than possible with Java.  

### 2019-20

This was the first year I ran the module and I split the time equally between C and Assembly programming. The students really struggled with the Assembly language portion of the module and it wasn't as effective as I'd planned for helping them understand the memory issues.  

### 2020-21

This year was taught online because of the Covid pandemic. I discuss the issues with the online provision [here](../../../CaseStudies/OnlineTeaching.md). In addition the complexity of  Assembly language and issues relating to different versions of assembly for different platforms led to a shift in the balance of the module. In this year the module focused mainly on C programming and the Assembly language component became a small part of the module.  

### 2021-22

The return to face to face teaching on campus didn't have a large affect on this module. The balance between C and Assembly remained as the 2020-21 year.
