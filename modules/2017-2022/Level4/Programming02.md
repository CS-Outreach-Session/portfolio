# Programming 02

## Module Code : 1CB105, COM4005M

## Overview

Programming 02 is a second semester module in first year. Prior to 2021-22 if followed on directly Programming 01, expanding students knowledge and practice using the Java programming language to include Object Oriented Programming. In 2021 Programming 01 was changed from Java to Python and Programming 02 was updated to teach Java from scratch while building on the programming techniques and approaches from Programming 01.  

### 2019-20

I took over this module in 2019 after Carl Heatherington left YSJ. The focus of this module is the principles and practices of the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. It develops the students knowledge of programming from Programming 01, introducing OOP techniques, giving the students the ability to design and develop applications. 

### 2020-21

During the Covid pandemic this module shifted to online delivery. Lectures and labs were delivered through MS Teams, the lectures were video recorded and uploaded so students could review the lectures at their leisure.  

The biggest challenge for this module was the development environment. Programming Java requires specialist software. While this software is freely and easily available, actually installing and getting it setup correctly can be difficult. Remotely supporting fifty students all trying to setup such software on their home systems, which can be Windows PCs, Linux PCs or Macs, would be a huge challenge. Additionally not every student has a computer at home so I sought out a different solution. I found [Replit](https://replit.com/), an online browser based coding environment which allows users to develop code in their browsers without installing any software. This is not an ideal solution, it can be a slow system to use, but its easy (and free) availability made it a good solution for the working from home situation.  

Additionally I mirrored the module content to an external website which I believe improved access for the students. It also enabled me to integrate the coding content on Replit with the module information on the website in a way I couldn't with Moodle. I go in to this in more detail [here - Online Teaching](../../../CaseStudies/OnlineTeaching.md).  

### 2021-22

In 2021 teaching moved back to in person in the classroom. I continued using the external website (a personal preference, I'm migrating back to Moodle for new modules starting 2022) but switched from using the Replit online system to Visual Studio Code (VSC) installed on the university computers. (Supporting students setting up VSC on thier own machines is easier face to face and most students work on campus so not every student needs supporting).
