# Software Engineering Design Patterns, Design Patterns for Games

## Module Code : 2CB105, COM5005M, 2CB106, COM5006M

## Overview

These two modules focus on the use of Design Patterns in the design and development of applications. Since the class sizes for both modules are small they have been taught as a single module since 2020. The content for the software engineering module is entirely applicable to the games development module. There is a little content (one lecture) which is specific to game development design patterns which is not directly applicable for the software engineers but the discussion and analysis of the patterns in the lecture is useful for them. Bringing the two modules together enables group project work.  

The two modules are assessed separately but in the same way. The module is assessed by a group project consisting of an application and documentation created by the group and a reflective report written individually. The focus is on the use and understanding of design patterns and Agile methodology rather than the completeness of the application.
