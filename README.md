# Dr Andrew Guest Academic Portfolio

## Background

I graduated from Aberdeen University in 1996 with an honours degree in Computing Science. After graduation I worked in software development mostly in the oil industry in Aberdeen, supporting and developing systems for Shell and BP.  

I left industry due to health issues and went back to university in 2006 to study Computer Animation & Graphics Technology Applications at Teesside University. It was during this period I discovered a love of academia. After gaining my Masters I moved to Dundee to study for a PhD at Abertay University.  

My PhD was part of a research group entitled "The Emergence of Artificial Culture in Robot Societies", investigating if the dynamics of imitation in swarm systems could lead to the emergence of proto-cultural artifacts. My thesis examined how different types of imitation could affect the duplication of sound memes when the robots audibly imitated each other.  

Throughout my PhD I taught at various levels at Abertay. Initially I worked as a lab assistant for a variety of computing and games development modules, running tutorials and giving the occasional lecture. During my last three years at Abertay I developed, ran and assessed modules in Software Engineering and Computer Systems.

After completing my PhD I returned for a short, unhappy period and then managed to secure this position at York St John in 2017. My role here is as lecturer in Computer Science and Games Development. I am the Games Development programme lead.  
## Pedagogy

My philosophy of teaching has accrued informally over time. I've never formally studying teaching theory, I've picked up bits and pieces as I've gone along. Some of it comes from articles and books I've found, some comes from discussions with, and recommendations by, colleagues, mostly it comes from experience in the classroom as a student, a lecturer and an observer.  

### Teaching In Computing - The Starting Point

Teaching in computing, at University level, faces a challenge that few other subjects have to deal with. Computing in secondary education varies greatly. Some schools have strong computing science programmes, some have taken an information technology route, and some have had no computing programme at all. This results in students leaving school with a range of computer science knowledge ranging from none at all to a thorough grounding in the basics, more than that for students that got the "coding bug" and have further developed their skills as a hobby. This range of ability level is common across all the subjects studied in school, some study history, some chemistry, some languages. Most subjects, at university level, can assume some expertise because the subject is well provided at secondary level (Maths, English, History, Geography, Chemistry, etc.), or work from the safe assumption that their students have little to no knowledge because the subject is not a school subject (Medicine. Law, etc).  

What is unusual is that the sporadic coverage of computing at secondary level means that universities have to start teaching computing, and coding specifically, assuming no previous knowledge but we do so in the knowledge that some of our students have a significant level of knowledge already. So we face the challenge of trying to engage and educate those with no previous subject knowledge while also engaging and providing value to those who already know the basics.  

The starting point for students on day one, term one, year one in computing ranges from students who have never used a computer, through those who have used a computer but never programmed or learned how a computer works, students who've done a little coding (enough to have a feel for what coding is like), up to students with a good grasp of the basics.  

The impact of this varies by module. For programming modules it matters a great deal, and at YSJ we have a strong thread of programming running through our Computing degrees. We also run modules on the impact of technology, research, and professional "soft skills", for these modules the range of prior experience is less significant. Or more accurately the range of prior skills is much smaller, to the point where it is no longer a concern in teaching.  

### Module Planning

The process of developing a module involves identifying the objectives, content teaching methods and assessment of the module, either linearly (Tyler 1949) or more iteratively (Taba 1962, Stenhouse 1957). I like the idea of discovery learning in curriculum design (Bruner 1966) but I find that getting students to engage and drive their own learning can be difficult (first year students are exceptionally good at finding distractions!) and it can be easy to fall back on simple. structured, content driven lectures.  

Technical subjects, like programming, match well with level based taxonomies of learning (Bloom & Krathwohl 1956, Dave 1970). Coding is typically taught in such a manner - first students code by imitating what they are shown, this becomes internalised and can be replicated from memory, then as understanding of the underlying concept grows they are able to manipulate the code to achieve different effects. This eventually leads to a deeper understanding and the ability to form links with other concepts, leading to mastery of the concept. As an example, in code terms, they begin by replicating the code for a for loop that they have been shown, they memorise the code format, learn to manipulate it for more complex loops, learn how the for loop relates to other types of loops and eventually know how, when and why to use a loop.  

I believe that engagement and challenge are the two key factors in module design. Every module should engage the students interests, it should nudge or tempt them in to wanting to learn more. Each module should also challenge the students at an appropriate level for each student.
