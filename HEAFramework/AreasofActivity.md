# Areas of Activity

I have been teaching at YSJ since the beginning of the 2017/18 academic year.

The modules listed below are 'my' modules. I have developed, taught and assessed them since I took them over between 2017 and 2019.  

* [Programming 02](../modules/2017-2022/Level4/Programming02.md)
* [Computer Games Fundamentals](../modules/2017-2022/Level4/ComputerGamesFundamentals.md)
* [Programming 03](./.modules/2017-2022/Level5/Programming03.md)
* [Design Patterns](../modules/2017-2022/Level5/DesignPatterns.md)
* [Game Engine Development](../modules/2017-2022/Level6/GameEngineDevelopment.md)
* [iOS Games Development](../modules/2017-2022/Level6/iOSGamesDevelopment.md)

We revalidated our degree programmes so students starting in the academic year 2022/23 will be taking new and reworked modules. This year I will be teaching the following new modules.  

* [Games Fundamentals](../modules/2022/Level4/GamesFundamentals.md)
* [Games Design](../modules/2022/Level4/GamesFundamentals.md)

Additionally I have taught the following modules.

* [Programming 01](../modules/2017-2022/Level4/Programming01.md)

## A1 - Design and plan learning activities and/or programmes of study

For all the modules listed above I planned out the module, prepared lectures, exercise material and assessments. Most modules were planned based on Module Specifications provided to me. These specifications were generally (and intentionally) as open as possible to allow lecturers flexibility in module content. The specifications contain a general overview of each module, a list of indicative content, the learning outcomes to be met and the assessment format. Based on this information, discussions with colleagues, and comparison to similar modules taught at other institutions I planned out the course of each module. My approach is to identify the required content as thematically grouped blocks and developed lectures for each block. During the semester I try to revise the content when students are struggling to progress (and occasionally when they progress faster than expected!).  

We have a strong focus on the practical application of knowledge, lab/tutorial exercises which reinforce and expand on knowledge from lectures form the key part of learning for most of our students.

We revalidated our degree programmes so the first year modules starting in 2022/3 (Games Fundamentals and Games Design) are new modules this year. I developed the module specifications for these modules (and a number of other modules that will start being taught in 2023/4 and 2024/5) as part of that revalidation. I discuss this more in the [Games Development Case Study](../CaseStudies/GamesDevRevalidation.md).  

## A2 - Teach and/or support learning

I gave weekly lectures and run tutorial lab sessions. The lectures introduce concepts, the theory behind those concepts and explain how to implement them. The lab exercises give the students the opportunity to implement those concepts themselves and then further develop their skills by applying those concepts in different situations.  These lectures and sessions are revised as required during teaching and revised between years based on reflection on how the students progressed, research and technology developments.  

I have also supported lecturers at the start of their career and lecturers new to York St John in understanding the York St John procedures and techniques. Where they have taken on a module I've taught previously I try to explain how that modules has been taught previously, which content is most important, where problems can occur and portential solutions to those problems. Supporting other lecturers like this is a satisfying challenge, helping them find their way to plan and teach a module is a joy.  

## A3 - Assess and give feedback to learners

All modules in Computing are marked by the Module Lead for the module. As such I set the assessments, marked the submissions and provided feedback to all the students on the modules I taught. We also have a moderation system where a second lecturer not involved with the running of the module moderates the assessment marking.  

My approach to assessment is to give students a general description of the task(s) required then a more detailed description of the steps involved. As part of the assessment brief I provide a marking scheme which breaks down how the marks for the assessment are awarded based on each task/step. Students should be able to use the marking scheme to identify which parts of the assessment require most effort.  

For marking I use an Excel spreadsheet that generates a sheet for each student. I use the sheet to enter marks based on the marking scheme (which is summarised on the sheet) and add comments by the marks to help the students understand the marks. At the bottom of the spreadsheet is a rubric that shows the students achievement at the broad task level for the assessment. When the marking is complete I run a macro that generates a pdf report for each student (it exports each students page as a pdf) and attach each report in Moodle so students have access to the feedback.  

Over the degree programme the depth and detail of the assessment task description. In first year I try to be as specific as possible - "You should do this, then this, then this in task one, then these steps in task 2" - with a detailed breakdown of how many marks for each individual step. In second year I describe the tasks but give less detail on the steps involved. The marking scheme still contains a detailed breakdown but those steps aren't spelled out. In third year the assessment is intentionally very broad, the tasks are not spelled out other than in broadstrokes and the marking scheme is less detailed. I find this reflects well the progress the students should (and generally are making). It also works well for the third year modules as they are generally of the "make a game that does X" format and students like the freedom to interpret that and not be (too) proscribed by required tasks.  

We have an issue where the University wants assessments to be anonymously marked so submissions through Moodle are anonymised. Our students submit their code through our GitLab server which is not anonymised. So the best case is we get anonymised reports/essays that contain a link to GitLab which identifies the student. The worst case is the student doesn't include the link in the report and doesn't put their name in the report, and we have no idea if they submitted code until the submission is de-anonymised and we aren't supposed to do that till marking is complete.  

**Examples**

* formative - incremental tasks work well - awareness that formative is ignored if it is not required
* Assessment
* Marking Spreadsheet
* Feedback Report 
* demonstration and code chat - collusion, plagiarism, demonstrate knowledge. (potential research - external dialogue)
  
## A4 - Develop effective learning environments and approaches to student support and guidance

I use Moodle modules pages to host content for each module. During the Covid Pandemic I also used an external website I managed to host module information. This gave me more flexibility and allowed be to link in tools for remote/online teaching more easily. I am migrating fully back to Moodle for the year 2022/3.  

During the pandemic I was able to find and utilise an online/web-page based Java and C compiler. While this approach had its issues (it could be very slow) it was an approached that worked for any student with a web-browser. Typically our students work in our labs using the machines we have set up. We often get a number of requestrs for help on setting up their own computers at home. These requests can be difficult and time consuming to fulfil when only a handful of students are asking. Without a browser based solution I'd have been faced with many requests and it wouldn't have been feasible to support them.  

We also begin recording the lectures (audio and video) during the pandemic and have continued that process.  

## A5 - Engage in continuing professional development in subjects/disciplines and their pedagogy, incorporating research, scholarship and the evaluation of professional practices

Continual development of technical skills and knowledge is essential in computing, the technology is constantly evolving. As part of the programme revalidation we had to consider which technologies, software and programming languages we would be teaching. This process involved examining the existing modules to see if anything was out of date, looking to see if anything that was now essential was missing, comparison to other institutions, feedback from industrial contacts, current research and pedagogy. This is discussed more in the [Game Development Revalidation case study](../CaseStudies/GamesDevRevalidation.md).
