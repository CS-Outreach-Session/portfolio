# Computer Games Fundamentals

## Module Code : 1CB104, COM4004M

## Overview

1CB104/COM4004M Computer Game Fundamentals is an introductory module for students on the Games Development Programme. The aim of the module is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts involved in developing computer games. This covers game development concepts and vocabulary, iterative game design/development and game frameworks and analysis.

### 2017/18

I strongly believe that  students studying for a degree in games development should be developing games throughout their degree. In my first year of running this module I included some game development using Java and a LibGD, A Java game library. Unfortunately this did not work out as well as I'd hoped. For about half the students (four out of eight) it worked really well. They picked up the coding quickly and enjoyed being able to actually put together games. The other half of the cohort had considerably weaker coding skills and struggled to keep up. This is a common problem with first year programming, our first year students have a wide range of coding experience.

### 2018/19

In 2018/19 the approach was be to examine the core concepts of games through board and card games. This is an approach that others have taken before. Brathwaite & Shrieber's book Challenges for Game Designers (Brathwaite & Shrieber 2008) presents a series of exercises designing board and card games to help digital game designers develop a better understanding of both the game design process and the way games work. Ian Schreiber's Game Design Concepts online tutorial series (Schreiber 2009) greatly influenced the structure and topics of this module. 

In 2018/19 this module examined the game design* process and give the students chance to explore that process though playing and developing boardgames. 

*game design is a tricky phrase, especially to computer scientists. To computer scientists "design" usually refers to designing code, the process of planning out a computer system before coding occurs. In terms of games (digital and analog) "design" can be taken to refer to the artistic design of visual components, the look of the game. For the purposes of this module "game design" refers to the process of designing a game - its concepts, its rules, how it plays, etc. We will touch on the other two definitions but this is the focus.

This module ran well and the feedback was good. Engagement was high and the students seem to have enjoyed it. One issue raised in the feedback was that it might be good to reflect back more strongly on why designing a boardgame is good for those wishing to be computer games developers. The students would like to have been developing computer games but understood the difficulties experienced the preevious year.  

### 2019/20

In 2019/20 the approach taken was similar to the previous year with the addition of collaboration with first year Illustration students taught by Charlene Clempson. The collaboration consisted of students from both modules working together to develop a boardgame. There were a few problems with scheduling and some students struggled with working with students from a different discipline. Learning to work with different disciplines is essential in most software development and especially games development so this was a good learning experience for the students.  

The collaborative work was spread over the course of the semester. This gave the students time to work on their games but did raise a few issues with keeping momentum and communication (especially between the disciplines). Discussion with Charlene led to future plans for bringing the students together for a couple of days two-thirds of the way through the semester for a mini game jam, where the collaborative work would be constrained to a two day event.  

Unfortunately..

### 2020/21

The Covid pandemic and lockdown lead to teaching shifting online. This made any group work difficult let alone group work for first year students who haven't met each other. Cross discipline collaborate proved impossible.  

In 2020/21 this module was taught entirely online. Lecture/labs were streamed online using MS Teams. To facilitate access to module material an external website was setup to mirror the content held on Moodle. (This wasn't strictly necessary, the external websites were used to faciliate the programming modules I taught at the time [see online teaching](../../../CaseStudies/OnlineTeaching.md)).  

The creation of physical boardgames was, at this point, not possible since students were not coming on to campus. To accomodate this a range of game engines/libraries were introduced to the students for them to individually make a game with. These varied in levels of technical complexity. [Twine](https://twinery.org/) is a tool for developing text based, branching stories ("choose your own adventure" style) requiring little technical knowledge/skill. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is an open source game engine. It is more technically complex than Twine but for students with some familiarity with game engines it is well supported and (relatively)  simple to use. [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) is a library for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. For students with coding experience this is a good starting option for games programming.  

The assessment was of the game development concepts and techniques explored/used in developing the game rather than the completeness/complexity of the game created.  

This approach worked well enough. It wasn't as satisfying as getting the students working together on a game but was the best option under the circumstances.  

### 2021/22

Uncertainty over the nature of teaching in the 2021/22 academic year (with respect to Covid lockdown) led to a decision over the summer of 2021 not to resume collaboration with Illustration (in 2021/22). This turned out to be the wrong decision as teaching was back in person in the classroom this year. 

I made the decision to continue with the approach from the previous year (using game engines) but returning to students working together in groups. This worked very well, the students enjoyed the group work and were engaged and interested in developing their games.  

### 2022/23

In 2021/22 we revalidated our existing degree programmes (see [Games Development Revalidation](../../../CaseStudies/GamesDevRevalidation.md)). This module will be replaced by [COM4014M Games Fundamentals](../../2022/Level4/GamesFundamentals.md) in semester 1 and [COM4015M Games Design](../../2022/Level4/GamesDesign.md) in semester 2.
