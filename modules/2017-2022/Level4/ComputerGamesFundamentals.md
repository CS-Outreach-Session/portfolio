# Computer Games Fundamentals

## Module Code : 1CB104, COM4004M

## Overview

1CB104 Computer Game Fundamentals is an introductory module for students on the Games Development Programme. The aim of the module is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts involved in developing computer games.

I took over this module at the beginning of the academic year 2017/18. At that time I decided to rework the module to include some games programming. I strongly believe that  students studying for a degree in games development should be developing games throughout their degree.

Unfortunately this did not work out as well as I'd hoped. For about half the students (four out of eight) it worked really well. They picked up the coding quickly and enjoyed being able to actually put together games. The other half of the cohort had considerably weaker coding skills and struggled to keep up. (they might have managed better if their attendance was better!)

I considered the possibility of moving this module from semester one to semester two in 2018/19 so that the students would already have completed their introductory programming module. This proved to be impossible to timetable.

For 2018/19 the module will have the coding content removed and will instead focus on the game development process and game design concepts. The students will learn about game mechanics by investigating and developing board and card games.

I still believe that games students should be developing games from the start of their degrees. This module will lay  the groundwork for understanding how games work, rather than how the code that runs games works. 

## Module Design

### 2017/18

When I took over this module in 2017/18 I felt it was important to include some game coding. Students on this module have come to study Games Development and it is important to engage with that interest and I wanted to do that by getting them making computer games as soon as possible. 

To achieve this I found a game library for Java (libGDX) that was fairly simple to use but still sophisticated enough to produce some interesting games. I was able to build lectures and lab exercises around examining game concepts through developing games in Java. 

Students starting at university on Computing degrees vary greatly in their experience of coding. Some have no experience at all. I knew this would be an issue for this module so I structured it so that the first three weeks involved no coding at all, focusing instead on the history of digital games and some key concepts (logic, number systems) that did not involve coding. I took this approach so that we would "lag behind" the introductory programming module the students were also taking.

The students would be introduced to the game library in week three and begin coding using it in week four. 

The approach taken was to cover the theory of a game concept (e.g the game loop, collision detection, animated sprites. etc.) during the lecture portion of the session and then use the lab session to implement the concept in the code. Lab sessions would be designed to follow on from the lectures and would show the students how to code the concepts. The idea was to walk the students through the coding process rather than asking them to work it out for themselves since the purpose of the module is to understand the concepts rather than teach coding.

#### Reflections on 2017/18

Including coding in the module produced a mixed bag of results. The students with experience of coding really did well and picked up the majority of the concepts and produced entertaining games for their assessment. The other students didn't cope with the coding at all. I believe there were a number of reasons for this - for some it was too much when they were only starting to code, there were issues with attendance and engagement with both this module and the introduction to programming. There were issues with timetabling and changing of degree programmes that meant some students didn't begin attending the module till mid-way through. There was also some comments about "expecting this to be an easy module" from those who transferred in later on.

The main issue though was the lack of coding knowledge/experience in some students. We discussed the possibility of moving the module to semester two in 2018/19 so that the students would all have completed the introductory programming module and we could assume (in theory) that they all had a base level of knowledge. It proved impractical to rearrange the timetabling to allow for this so, with regret, it was decided to remove coding from the module from 2018/19.

### 2018/19

The decision to remove coding from the module means it had to be redeveloped.

The focus of the module remains examining the core concepts of game design and development. In 2018/19 the approach will be to examine the core concepts of games through board and card games. This is an approach that others have taken before. Brathwaite & Shrieber's book Challenges for Game Designers (Brathwaite & Shrieber 2008) presents a series of exercises designing board and card games to help digital game designers develop a better understanding of both the game design process and the way games work. Ian Schreiber's Game Design Concepts online tutorial series (Schreiber 2009) greatly influenced the structure and topics of this module. 

In 2018/19 this module examined the game design* process and give the students chance to explore that process though playing and developing boardgames. 

Each session will followed a similar structure consisting of three parts. The first part consists of a lecture about a game design concept and an introduction to a boardgame that exemplifies that concept. The second part gives the students chance to play that game. This is followed by a discussion of how the game plays with regards to the concept. Students were also given time to work on the coursework.

*game design is a tricky phrase, especially to computer scientists. To computer scientists "design" usually refers to designing code, the process of planning out a computer system before coding occurs. In terms of games (digital and analog) "design" can be taken to refer to the artistic design of visual components, the look of the game. For the purposes of this module "game design" refers to the process of designing a game - its concepts, its rules, how it plays, etc. We will touch on the other two definitions but this is the focus.

### Reflections on 2018/19

 This module ran well this year and the feedback has been good. Engagement was high and the students seem to have enjoyed it. One issue raised in the feedback was that it might be good to reflect back more strongly on why designing a boardgame is good for those wishing to be computer games developers. I agree with this, this was a topic we discussed but only at a general level, rather than explicitly showing how practices and principles apply in the computer game industry.

The students would like to have been developing computer games but understood the difficulties we experienced last year. There are game development systems that can be used with very little coding knowledge, as part of planning for next year I am examining the possibility of using one or two of them in the module. There is also an application called "Tabletop Simulator", a physics based world simulator, that is used to simulate a table, game board, cards, dice, tokens, etc. I am looking at using that software to (a) demonstrate games and (b) get the students to develop simulations of the boardgames they develop for the assessment.

I have also been in contact with Charlene Clempson (Illustration lecturer in the school of Art, Design & Computing) with regards to having the Games Development and Games Design students collaborate in the production of the games built for the assessment for this module.
